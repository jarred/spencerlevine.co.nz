# Family Songbook 

## By Kerrin P. Sharpe
## Victoria University Press
 

'We all carry in our heads private landscapes – the geography of our youth refracted by memory, changing hopes and desires, personal mythology, family history. Newton’s songbook re-examines and revitalises half-forgotten possibilities.’
Iain Sharp
