# Reptiles and Amphibians of New Zealand

## Auckland University Press

## by Dylan van Winkel, Marleen Baling and Rod Hitchmough

From the ancient tuatara, the sole surviving member of its order, to the world’s largest collection of long-lived and live-bearing lizards, our geckos and skinks, New Zealand’s 123 species of reptiles and amphibians represent an extraordinary aspect of this country’s biodiversity. This is the definitive field guide to all of New Zealand’s tuatara, geckos, skinks, frogs, marine turtles and marine snakes.
