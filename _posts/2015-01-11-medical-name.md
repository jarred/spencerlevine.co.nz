# There’s a Medical Name for This

## by Kerrin P. Sharpe
## Victoria University Press

The pilgrim poems in this collection persuade the other poems and the readers to join them on a quest for personal meaning.  All the while there is the feeling that the movement forward is really towards the place where it all began. There’s a Medical Name for This is the second collection by Kerrin P. Sharpe, following on from Three Days in A Wishing Well.
