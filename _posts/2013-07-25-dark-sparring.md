# Dark Sparring

## Auckland University Press
## By Selena Tusitala Marsh

I had never danced the fatele before. Then, five days after mother died, our Tuvalu relatives came to the house, rolled up the mats on the floor, and started drumming. We moved around the coffin, feet stamping an escalating rhythm while hands and heads swayed, tilting right then left. Voices filled the lounge as mother's body was carried out the front door.

In Dark Sparring, Selina Tusitala Marsh combats family loss with all the techniques of poetry, ritual and Thai kickboxing at her disposal.
