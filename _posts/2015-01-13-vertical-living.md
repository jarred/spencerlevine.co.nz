# Vertical Living

## Auckland University Press

## By Julia Gatley & Paul Walker

Vertical Living offers a history of urban Wellington from the 1940s to the 1990s and beyond. 

In 1946 a group of students and idealists got together to realise their visions for a modern city. Over the following half century, the Architectural Centre they founded helped to shape the possibilities of modern life in urban New Zealand and profoundly influenced the remaking of Wellington. Charting these activists and their projects over the years, The book reminds us that, in modernist ideology, architecture and urban planning went hand-in-hand with visual and craft arts, graphic and industrial design.
