# Pou Kanohi

## Auckland War Memorial Museum

Pou Kanohi is the Museum’s first dedicated war memorial space aimed at educating young people about the War. Rich with collections, the gallery shares New Zealanders’ experiences of WWI from multiple perspectives, and presents the key events of the war through an illustrated multimedia timeline, enhanced with objects and immersive interactive experiences.
