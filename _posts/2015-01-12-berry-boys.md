# Berry Boys

## Te Papa Press
## By Michael Fitzgerald & Claire Regnault

A surprise discovery in the 1980s unearthed the remarkable early twentieth century photographs of Berry & Co., now held in Te Papa’s collection. Amongst the thousands of mystery images are more than a hundred of ordinary First World War servicemen, taken directly before the men left to fight. Berry Boys features the full collection of beautifully reproduced portraits, accompanied by the unique stories of the soldiers and their loved ones. Although they are only a fraction of the thousands of men who served, they offer a potent snapshot of the New Zealand of the time – and the changing face of the First World War itself.
