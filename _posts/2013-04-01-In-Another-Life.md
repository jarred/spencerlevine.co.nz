# In Another Life

## Patricia Piccinni
## City Gallery Wellington

Exhibition catalogue

In Another Life is all about possibilities. In another life it would be different, we might say, in another life it might be better, or perhaps worse, in another life we could get it right. In imagining another life we can remake the world as we would prefer, we can create a perfect life without having to see whether it would actually work, we can just trust that it would all turn out.
