# Puna Wai Kōrero

## Auckland University Press
## Edited by Reina Whaitiri & Robert Sullivan

Vertical Living offers a history of urban Wellington from the 1940s to the 1990s and beyond. 

In this pioneering new anthology, two leading Māori scholars collect Māori poetic voices in English and let flow a wellspring of poetry. From both revered established writers and exciting newer poets, the works in Puna Wai Kōrero offer a broad picture of Māori poetry in English. Writers and orators of Te Ao Māori have  for centuries been deeply engaged with poetic forms, and Puna Wai Kōrero traces this past whakapapa and celebrates its present-day strength.
