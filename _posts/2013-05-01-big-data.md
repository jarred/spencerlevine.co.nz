# Big Data

## National Library of New Zealand

Big Data is the new National Library's inaugural programme of exhibitions, seminars, and workshops. Humanity has developed powerful tools to sense and depict our planet â€“ the creation and use of data. In the era of big data and rapid change, where are the places and sites that hold personal and community meaning? The exhibition initially looks at the Thorndon area and examines how our interaction with Data through time has shaped our place in the world.
