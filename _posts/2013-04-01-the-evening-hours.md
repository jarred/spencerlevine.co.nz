# The Evening Hours

## Victoria University Press
## Photographs by Ben Cauchi

The Evening Hours brings together new writing on Ben Cauchi’s practice with reproductions of over eighty of his photographs. Arriving from another time and place, yet thoroughly of the present – his use of the mid-nineteenth-century wet collodion photographic process is a means to question and undermine the certainties that we continue to invest in the photographic image.
