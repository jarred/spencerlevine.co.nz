# The Families

## by Vincent O’Sullivan

## Victoria University Press

Fourteen magnificent new stories from a New Zealand master.
O’Sullivan’s stories exhibit a shrewd understanding that pierces to the heart of what it means to be human. O’Sullivan can mock, satirise and laugh, but he also finds dignity in unexpected places. He is interested in the art of living, and in the borderland where truth and lies meet, both in life and in fiction itself. —The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature
