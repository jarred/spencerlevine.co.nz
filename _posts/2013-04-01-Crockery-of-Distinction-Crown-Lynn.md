# Crown Lynn: Crockery of Distinction 

## City Gallery Wellington

Exhibition notes 

From select examples of Crown Lynnâ€™s mass produced lines, through to the self-consciously modern designs of some key designers, these objects are considered for their continuing relevance in our cultural history. Rather than presenting a single definitive narrative, this exhibition navigates some of the myriad lines of fascination Crown Lynn holds over twenty years after its closure.
