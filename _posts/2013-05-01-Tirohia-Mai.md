# Tirohia Mai Look at us now

## National Library of New Zealand

New Zealand women won the vote 120 years ago.  Tirohia Mai looks at where women
stand now, how they got here, and how they see themselves in 2013. It celebrates
the rich diversity of women and their contributions to making New Zealand what
it is today and will be tomorrow.
