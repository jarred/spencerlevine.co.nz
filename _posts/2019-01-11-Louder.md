# Louder

## Victoria University Press

## by Kerrin P. Sharpe

and if you can imagine

thousands of elephants

all in outdoor studios

painting themselves and their tribe

as whole elephants

even as guns are raised

and calves stumble


In her arresting new book, Kerrin P. Sharpe raises her voice to address with passion and urgency the political, moral and ecological injustices of the world today.
