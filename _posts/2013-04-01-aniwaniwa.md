Exhibition notes for Aniwaniwa. 

Aniwaniwa is a collection of wakahuia with internal projections and sound components suspended from the ceiling;large carved sculptures holding memories of a place now submerged under water – a stirring tribute to Horahora village where Brett Graham’s father lived and his grandfather worked at the power station.
