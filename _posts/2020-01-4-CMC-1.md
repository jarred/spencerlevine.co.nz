# Colin McCahon: There Is Only One Direction, Vol. I 1919–1959

## Auckland University Press

## Peter Simpson

The first of an extraordinary two-volume work chronicling forty-five years of Colin McCahon’s life and work. Colin McCahon (1919–1987) was New Zealand’s greatest twentieth-century artist. Through landscapes, biblical paintings and abstraction, the introduction of words and Māori motifs, McCahon’s work came to define a distinctly New Zealand modernist idiom. Collected and exhibited extensively in Australasia and Europe, McCahon’s work has not been assessed as a whole for thirty-five years.
