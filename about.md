Spencer Levine set up his own design studio in 2008 in Wellington. Encompassing clients of all sizes, from arts organisations to Government, his work is largely print based with a heavy lean towards book publishing and exhibition design.

He works with his clients, enjoying the process of collaboration – working with them to produce unique, polished award winning work which reflects the efforts of all involved. A new shift towards exhibition related work, with some spatial design, and exhibition branding have recently provided new opportunities for great partnering with more institutional focused clients.
