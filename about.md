Spencer Levine set up his own design studio in 2008 in Wellington. Encompassing clients of all sizes, from arts organisations to Government, his work is largely print based with a heavy lean towards book publishing and exhibition design.

He works with his clients, enjoying the process of collaboration & working with them to produce unique, polished award winning work which reflects the efforts of all involved. A new shift towards exhibition related work, with some spatial design, and exhibition branding have recently provided new opportunities for great partnering with more institutional focused clients.

Spencer Levine has been selected as an approved supplier on the All of Government Design Services Panel (AOG) to provide design services.
