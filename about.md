Spencer Levine set up his shop in 2008 in Wellington. He works with his clients, enjoying the process of collaboration, and working with them to produce unique, polished, award winning work which reflects the efforts of all involved. Encompassing clients of all sizes, from arts organisations to Government, his work is largely print based with a heavy lean towards book publishing and exhibition design.

A shift towards exhibition related work, including exhibition branding and catalogues have recently provided new opportunities for partnering with more institutional focused clients.

To get in contact the traditional way stop by â€“ the studio is located at Level 2, 27 Dixon Street, Wellington. Spencer is seldom there, but is happy to meet by appointment. Or [email](mailto:spence@spencerlevine.co.nz).
